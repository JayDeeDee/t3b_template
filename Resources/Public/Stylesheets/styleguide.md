# CSS styleguide for <!= pkg.name !>

### About
A living styleguide aims at making sure your CSS components, and it's documentation are in sync with a styleguide for your dev-team/customer. The integration of new team members into the project get's a whole lot easier, as you'll just need to point them to this styleguide to see the existing components of a web page in a clean environment.

### How do I document a new component on my own?
The styleguide gets generated with [Kalei Styleguide](http://hughsk.io/kss-node/) - please visit the project page and head to the documentation section.

As soon as you update your Sass files, you will see the changes to your components here, go ahead and do some awesome stuff!
